Is the string uppercase?

Task

Create a method `isUppercase()` to see whether the string is ALL CAPS. For example:

Corner Cases

For simplicity, you will not be tested on the ability to handle corner cases (e.g. `"%*&#()%&^#"` or similar strings containing alphabetical characters at all) - an **ALL CAPS (uppercase)** string will simply be defined as one containing no lowercase letters. Therefore, according to this definition, strings with no alphabetical characters (like the one above) should return `True`.
